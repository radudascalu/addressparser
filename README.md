# Tests

Story: FRIDAY wants to split the addresses they get into Street and Housenumber.
You can import parse_address from app.py and use the parse_adress function. It returns None if it can't parse the address and the parsed address if parsing is possible.

You can run python tests.py for the end-to-end tests. Unit tests for each specific rule have not yet been implemented due to time constraints.
